00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
האוטומציה והבינה המלאכותית.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ומשמש כמוביל דעה בתחום האינטגרציה

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi, Bill.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I understand you need to hire a new bartender.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I sure do.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I run a bar downtown

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and I need someone who's experienced

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and a real problem solver.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Got it.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So I'll ask some behavioral-based questions.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Then I can see how each candidate's past experience

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
relates to the role you're hiring for.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Strong answers should follow this star format.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Candidates, are you ready?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Jessica, you're up first.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Tell us about a time when you made a mistake

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and what you learned from it.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In my last job, I was responsible for processing returns.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One customer ordered the same outfit

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
in a bunch of different sizes.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
She kept one and returned the rest.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But I credited too much money back into her account.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My manager was pretty frustrated.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The whole situation really turned me off

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
from working in online sales.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which is one of the reasons I want to work here.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thanks, Jessica.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Next, we have Carlos.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Look, I bartended seven years.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I really don't make mistakes anymore.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I mean, I did way back when I was younger.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've warmed up a few kegs.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I fell for a couple of counterfeit 20s,

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
but that's ancient history.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Look, if I'm your new bartender,

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
you can be confident that you're going to have

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
a professional back there, someone who's seen it all.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who doesn't make mistakes?

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, Carlos.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hi, Sandra.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're up.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, at one of my first catering jobs,

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I uncorked all the wine before we started serving.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But then most people drank fear.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You know, it was an expensive mistake.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So before the next party,

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I asked if I could shadow my boss as she set up.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I made a checklist so I would know

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
what tasks to do in the right order.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I still use that task list.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It probably would apply here.

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you, Sandra.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jessica shared an honest mistake.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But then what?

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Her answer fell flat because she didn't share what she learned.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Carlos named two mistakes.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But then he dismissed them.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Maybe he could have shared how we mastered correctly tapping a keg,

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
or spying a fake 20.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That would have been more effective.

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I thought Sandra's answer was great.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
She quickly explained the mistake,

70
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but spent most of her response

71
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
talking about the steps she took to overcome it.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
She even connected what she learned to this new role.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Next up, round two.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tell me about a time you dealt with a difficult or tough situation at work.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think the toughest situation is when you don't know how to do something.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
See, I'm the type of person who likes to be in control.

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I want to make sure that I know how to do every single task.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When I first started at my sales job,

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I had to ask a million questions.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
For some people, that's hard, but not me.

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not afraid to ask for help.

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Carlos, you're up.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Just last month, one of my regulars had too much to drink.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Now, if I serve in the toxicated patron who gets into an accident,

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm liable.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But I had to stop serving him in a way that wouldn't escalate the situation,

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
so I closed his tab.

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I got him a glass of water, and then I privately told him

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that he could stick around while he's sobered up.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Eventually, I called a cab.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I maintained his dignity, and I kept everyone safe,

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
because when you work at a bar, customer safety

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
is a big part of customer service.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I like what I'm hearing.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Last but not least, Sandra.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My first catering boss told me to keep serving drinks

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
no matter how intoxicated someone gets.

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But that just didn't sit right with me.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I once told this woman that she had enough to drink,

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but she just got her friend to get her a drink instead.

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So since then, I figured the main goal is to keep the customer happy.

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I mean, so if someone gets out of hand at your bar,

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I would ask the bouncer to throw them out,

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
because there's the bouncer, right?

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right?

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's a problem.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I love Jessica's confidence, but she should share a specific example.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The star method would help.

111
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sandra shared a specific story,

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
but her action didn't improve the situation.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It just didn't seem like she was taking ownership.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Carlos's answer had all four elements of the star method.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When he said,

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I maintained his dignity and kept everyone safe,

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I understood exactly how he made a difficult situation better.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's time for the last round.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Final question, we'll start off with Jessica.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Explain a time when you had to multitask and how you handled it.

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So when I'm out with my friends,

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm always the person taking all our drink orders,

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
just like a bartender.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I go over everything that everyone wants,

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and I repeat it out loud to myself at least three times.

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
When I get to the bar,

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I order draft beers first, then the mix drinks.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It gets confusing when people change their minds, though.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then you have to fix a mistake and still keep track of everything.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay, very cool. Carlos, you're up.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Just last month,

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I had two of my barbacks and a way to call out sick.

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I was taking orders, I was getting nice,

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
making drinks, stocking.

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was impossible.

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Multitasking, it can be really tough,

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
and in those situations, no one wins.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Thanks, Carlos.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sandra!

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
While when you bartend at weddings,

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
everyone wants to get a drink at the same time.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
During my first few gigs, I came up with three rules.

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Number one, always finish every order before taking the next one.

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Number two, to reduce the flow of new orders,

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I only make eye contact when I'm ready to take new orders.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And three, I trust my system.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So I'm polite, but firm if I'm getting hounded.

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And since I started putting them into practice,

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm more calm, I make fear mistakes,

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and have more fun catering weddings.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well done.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Jessica's answer could have had all the star elements,

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
but her action wasn't clear.

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And since she didn't share a clear action,

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
she couldn't share its results.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Carlos was specific,

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and he did explain how we jumped in to save the day.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But did the situation improve?

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Sandra gave context and clearly explained the challenge.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Bill, I think we're ready for your decision.

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
These behavioral questions really help me get a sense of each candidate's past experiences.

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
One contestant consistently set the scene,

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
told us the challenge, shared what they tried,

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and explained what happened as a result.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sandra is the strongest candidate.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That means Sandra moves forward in the interview process.

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Remember, if you're asked a behavioral question at your next interview,

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
apply the star method.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It helps connect your past experience to the role you're applying for.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
