1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
was even more demanding, teaching.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework assignments.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When the work came back, I calculated grades.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And that got me thinking.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ratio, decimals, the area of a parallelogram.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But these concepts are not impossible.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
they worked hard and long enough.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective,

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
from a psychological perspective.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
learn quickly and easily?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
out.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
in competition.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And of those, who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students?

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We partnered with private companies asking which of these salespeople is going to keep

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
their jobs?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And who is going to earn the most money?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
of success.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And it wasn't social intelligence.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It was grit.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Grit is having stamina.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Grit is sticking with your future.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
really hard to make that future a reality.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A few years ago, I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
around more than a year to see who would graduate.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure, things like family income,

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt when they were at school.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters, it's also

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
in school, especially for kids at risk for dropping out.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
about building it.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, how do I build grit in kids?

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How do I keep them motivated for the long run?

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The honest answer is, I don't know.

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
follow through on their commitments.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
grows in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit, but we need more.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And that's where I'm going to end my remarks, because that's where we are.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's the work that stands before us.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions, and we need to test them.

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We need to measure whether we've been successful, and we have to be willing to fail, to be

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
wrong, to start over again with lessons learned.

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.
